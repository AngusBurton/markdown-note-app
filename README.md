# Markdown Notetaking App that formats into HTML

This project was created using electronJS with ReactJS components as the frontend. It allows a user to write quickly in markdown and then whatever is written will be automatically formatted into a nice looking HTML document in real time. This is done using txt files on the users local machine and it will save to the file automatically after 3 seconds of no typing.

I got the idea for this project by doing my own note taking for uni and realsing how much easier it would be if I didn't have to worry about formatting my notes.

### `yarn electron:serve`

Runs the app, an electron window should pop up on your desktop.
